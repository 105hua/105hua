# :wave: Welcome

Hello, my name is Josh and I am an 18 year old Computer Science student from the UK. I really enjoy programming and playing games like Rust, X-Plane 11 and Minecraft.

I am currently working on designing a range of Rust servers for the RAT Media Group, an upcoming organization.

# :computer: Programming

In terms of languages, I actively program in:
- C#
- Visual Basic
- Node.js
- Java

I don't really plan to learn any new programming languages soon as I am confident with the four I have just mentioned.
