# :wave: Welcome to my profile!

Hello! My name is Josh and I'm and 18 year old Computer Science student based in the United Kingdom. I do a lot of programming as well as play a handful of games like Roblox, Hearts of Iron 4, Forza Horizon 5 and Geometry Dash.

I am currently working on a couple of Roblox games, some my own, some on behalf of RAT Media Group, an organization that I work for. I am also considering a couple of other projects, such as a LUA Discord Bot.

# :computer: Programming

As I said in the welcome section, I do a lot of programming. I have experience with a wide range of languages, however, currently, I would say I specialise in:
- C#
- LUA
- Node.JS

From time to time, I dabble in other languages, such as C++ and React, however, they aren't my go to languages.
