# :wave: Welcome

Hello, my name is Josh and I am a 17 year old Computer Science student from the UK. I really enjoy programming and playing games like X-Plane 11, FiveM, Minecraft etc.

I am currently working on a small Forge Mod that adds Emerald Tools to Minecraft 1.14.4 with a friend of mine, Zappg. We also have a Golden Fishing Rod mod planned for the future.
This mod is in an early phase as we are still learning how to program mods with Forge, although I do have some experience with Java from past projects.

# :computer: Programming

In terms of languages, I actively program in:
- C#
- Visual Basic
- Node.js
- Java

I don't really plan to learn any new programming languages soon as I am confident with the four I have just mentioned.
