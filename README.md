# :wave: Hello!

My name is Josh and I'm a 19 year old BSc Computer Science student based in the United Kingdom. I enjoy programming, playing video games (These days, mostly Roblox, Hearts of Iron IV and Minecraft) and learning about Cryptocurrency. Currently, I am working for a couple of organisations, such as RAT Media Group and Apollo Network. I am also working on building a portfolio of applications as well as maintaining some hobby projects, such as Security Module Revived.

# :computer: Programming

I started programming in 2014, on my entry into Secondary School. My first programming languages were Python and Batch and some of my first projects were a Registration & Login Program and a Website for a Holiday Park. When I transitioned from Secondary School to College to study A-Level Computer Science, I learned C# and VB.NET. Throughout my studies in college, I would tend to choose VB.NET over C# for my projects because of it's simplicity, however, shortly after finishing my studies at College, I quickly switched back to C# and have not considered any plans to change again since. One of the projects that I am most proud of during my studies in College was Kasegeru, which was a Virtual Learning Environment designed with Security being the top priority. The program enabled Students and Teachers to manage assignments, rewards, announcements etc.

As of 4th February 2022, I am in my first year of studying a BSc in Computer Science. So far, I have learned more advanced concepts in C# and taught myself Gatsby.
